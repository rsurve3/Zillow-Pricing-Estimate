**Conformed Dimension**

When a dimension table connects to more than one fact table, it represents the same dimension table in both schemas, then, we refer to such dimension tables as conformed between the two-dimensional models.
In our model, the conformed dimensions are:
Property
Professionals
Agents
Location

**Conclusion**
The Structure and Price Dashboards assist Zillow in making critical pricing decisions and forecasting the Zestimate.
Zillow ceased buying homes for cash through its Zillow Offers program after discovering it was losing money in that area by employing such sophisticated data analytics and visualizations.
Such analysis is being done now on a broad scale to sell about 3800 to 7000 homes at a profit after the company altered its focus from buying houses to just being an intermediary for brokers and clients.
